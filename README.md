# RAG_Carbon_Emissions

### RAG-Based Research Assistant for Carbon Emission Analysi.

This project involves developing a `Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)` application to support research on `Carbon Emissions`. The system integrates a language model with a document retrieval component to fetch relevant scientific articles, and environmental reports. It enables dynamic, accurate, and context-aware answers to user queries, aiding in comprehensive analysis and understanding of carbon emission trends, sources, and mitigation strategies.
